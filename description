	Following a tutorial from Microsoft (<a class="hover:bg-yellow-300 hover:text-slate-900 rounded" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app"><u>link</u></a>), I developed an online movie database web app using the MVC framework. The app displays key details for each movie, including the title, release date, genre, price, and rating.

	Users can filter movies by genre using a dropdown menu or by title using the search bar. For instance, entering "ghost" in the search bar will display all movies with "ghost" in the title.

	The app also supports full CRUD functionality, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete movies in the database.
